## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for a **semi-analytic study of cosmic hydrogen reionization**.  
The project focuses on modeling the evolution of the ionized hydrogen fraction during the Epoch of Reionization and investigating its dependence on key astrophysical parameters.

---

## Project Objectives
- Implement **Press- Schectar formalism** to compute the halo mass function relevant to reionisation.
- Model the **Ionised hydrogen volume fraction(Q_HII)** as a function of redshift.
- Solve reionization equations to compute the **redshift evolution of the ionized volume filling factor**.
